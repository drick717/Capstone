## Welcome to my Project Repository

**Here you will find links to all of the files for projects that I've completed or that I am currently working on.** 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My latest project has been an attempt to take my very first programming project for a class and update it with 
some of the skills I've learned over the last few years.  It's a very simple zoo login program that was originally 
written in Java that I have modified.  I've included an audio screencast code review that discusses all of the flaws
in the original program, along with my planned enhancements.  I then updated the program through a series of uploads: 
a direct rewrite into C++ maintaining as much of the original structure as possible, an update to that file to address
the addition of functions and data structures to make it more modular, and finally and additional program that uses 
embedded SQL through SQLite to build a menu that could be accessed after a sucessful login attempt.
